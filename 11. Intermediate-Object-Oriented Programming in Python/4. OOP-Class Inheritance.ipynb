    "# Class Inheritance\n",

    "One of the main advantages of OOP paradigm is **class inheritance**. This allows defining new classes from other classes that are already defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The new class is called a subclass or a derived class while the class this new subclass is derived from is called the base class or superclass.   \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - The subclass (child class) inherits all the attributes and methods of its base class.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - If a superclass and a subclass both have a method with the same name, the method in the subclass will override the one in the superclass. In short, subclasses extends and/or overrides the functionality of base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will discuss how to derive a class from other classes using inheritance. class inheritance enhance code reuse and fast program development. \n",
