    "\n",
    "A package is a directory (folder) that contains a set of modules and an empty file called \\__init\\__.py \n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that similar modules be saved in the same package while different modules saved in different packages. This will make the project easy to manage and more clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Python has _packages for directories_ and _modules for files_. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a set of modules for reading and writing different graphics formats, e.g., Bmp.py, Jpeg.py, Gif.py and Png.py, it is not good idea to keep these modules in the same directory as your program. Instead you can save them in a separate subdirectory called, for example, **Graphics**. Each subdirectory should have an empty \\__init\\__.py file to tell Python that this subdirectory is a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Graphics/ \n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        Bmp.py\n",
    "        Jpeg.py\n",
    "        Gif.py\n",
    "        Png.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "As long as the Graphics package or subdirectory is inside the program's directory or in the Python path (Python folder), any of the modules within that package can be imported and used.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**NOTE**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Your package name should be not the same as any of the built-in packages in Python standard library, to avoid name conflicts. You can start the package name with uppercase letter."
